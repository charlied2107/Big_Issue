# Data

Just a brief description of the data used in this analysis.

There are 4 files which I am going to import to this file later, two for Kenya, two for Bangladesh.

For Kenya, there are "Kenya_Wealth", "Kenya_Income", and in each of them, it contains the following indicators:

- Gini coefficient
- Share of income/wealth held by highest 1%
- Share of income/wealth held by highest 10%
- Share of income/wealth held by bottom 50%
- Share of income/wealth held by middle 40%
