# Big Issue

This is the Github respository for Big Issue group project.


## 15-Nov

I have uploaded a few files and a folder called "Data" which involves the income and wealth data for Kenya and Bangladesh. 
I initially tried to use the csv file generated by WID website, but the format which it uses is quite odd, so I think probably we shall download the .xlsx file
in the futurte for convenience. (do check out the Question1.Rmd importing that csv takes far more steps.)

For the data: I have included Gini coefficient, share of income/wealth of the top 1%, top 10%, bottom 50%, and middle 40% for each of them.
